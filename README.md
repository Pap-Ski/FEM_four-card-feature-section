## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learnt how to add the `box-shadow` property to an element. Essentially the first unit caters for the horizontal axis, the second for the vertical, the third for the blur, and the last value being the color of the shadow.

```css
.card {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  padding: 1.2em;
  margin-bottom: 2em;
  border-radius: 0.4em;
  box-shadow: 0em 0.5em 0.5em var(--clr-nue-gb);
}
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powel's CSS box shadow tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNRQ5HjNeI) - This helped me add the `box-shadow` feature to the 4 cards.
